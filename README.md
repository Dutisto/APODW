# Astronomy Picture of the Day Wallpaper

A simple service based on Astronomy Picture of the Day by the NASA (https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html)

The service check every hour if a new picture is available, if so download it and set it as your new wallpaper.

## Installing

Simply run sudo bash install.sh with the username of the user you want to run the service as. (You will want to set it as the current user)

```
sudo bash install.sh dutisto
```

## Compatibility

I developed it using Ubuntu 16.04, but this should be fine with any linux distros using SystemD

## Contributing
